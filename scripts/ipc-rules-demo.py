# This is a simple script which demonstrates how to use the Wayfire IPC socket with the wayfire_socket.py helper.
# To use this, make sure that the ipc plugin is first in the plugin list, so that the WAYFIRE_SOCKET environment
# variable propagates to all processes, including autostarted processes.
# To use this script, the ipc-rules plugin should also be enabled, as it provides some of the basic events and commands
# required for IPC interaction.
#
# Lastly, this script can be run from a terminal for testing purposes, or started as an autostart entry.
# It is safe to kill/restart the process at any point in time.
